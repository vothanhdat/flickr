| What is virtual gifting?
^ Virtual Gifts are small tokens of appreciation that you can send to friends, family，your favorite indy band or youtube celebrities. It’s a way to support and thank artists for sharing their work with the community. Additionally, virtual gifting is a personalized way to show some love. Instead of creators using a paypal donation link or trying to monetize their channels through annoying ads that ruin the fan experience, content creators can set-up the Universal Gifting protocol on their platform and offer fans a fun way to interact with their favorite celebrities. 

Virtual gifts come in many different styles and values. Fans can buy GTO tokens through the platform, choose the gift they wish to send, and send fun virtual gifts anytime. Content creators can see these gifts, see which individuals sent them gifts, who their superfans are, and can then take the gifts and turn them into GIFTO tokens to hold, trade or sell on crypto platforms. In addition to GIFTO’s broad selection of gifts, fans and artists in the Gifto community can apply to become gift curators.
